# StockMarketLive â€“ Stock Market Prices Application
### Technologies: P/E/R/N + Socket.IO + ChartJS

*Hosted on [Heroku](https://stockmarketlive.herokuapp.com/)*

<sub>Created as a part of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Legacy Back End Certification</sub>

\* Yahoo Finance API, which is used in this application, seems to be down (at least at the moment), so this app is very unlikely to work properly as well, until another working stocks API is connected to it. And that is what I am looking for currently.
